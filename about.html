                        <h2>Ethical AI Collaboration in Practice</h2>
                        <p>This website was created through a deliberate, ethically-conscious collaboration between human intention and AI assistance, specifically using Warp terminal and Claude AI. The process serves as a practical demonstration of the principles outlined in the advocacy statement—showing how AI tools can be used responsibly in software development when guided by experienced human oversight.</p>
                        
                        <p>Rather than accepting AI-generated code blindly, every step involved critical evaluation, iterative refinement, and human decision-making. The entire development process exemplifies how developers can harness AI capabilities while maintaining agency over their craft and ensuring quality outcomes.</p>

                            <li><strong>Inter</strong> - A modern sans-serif font used for headings and navigation elements</li>
                            <li>Optimized line height, letter spacing, and font sizes for comfortable reading</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This project serves as a practical demonstration of the advocacy statement's core principles:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Experience-Driven AI Usage</strong> - AI tools were handled with the care and oversight that the statement advocates</li>
                            <li><strong>Maintained Developer Agency</strong> - Human decision-making remained central throughout the development process</li>
                            <li><strong>Transparency in AI Assistance</strong> - Full documentation of AI involvement prevents the "black box" problems discussed in the statement</li>
                            <li><strong>Skill Development Preservation</strong> - The process enhanced rather than replaced human technical understanding</li>
                            <li><strong>Responsible Tool Usage</strong> - Demonstrated that AI tools, like "power tools in the woodshop," can be used safely with experienced hands</li>
